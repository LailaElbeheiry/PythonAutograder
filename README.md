## Usage Intructions
 
The tool works in three dependent stages (it is in our intention for the future to merge these into one stage for convenience).

* Stage 1:
 The first thing that you need to do is to run interface.py and input your test data.

* Stage 2:
 The second thing that you need to do is to run function_generator.py and input your reference function. Note that 
 there is a specific format for this step, so please follow the instructions in the file.
 
* Stage 3:
  Lastly, run the file allTest.py to grade the python assignment. Note that in order for this to work, you need to have the source file     that you are grading in the same directory under the name "lab1.py"
